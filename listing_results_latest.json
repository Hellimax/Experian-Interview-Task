            "suggestions": "1. **APR Disclosure**: Combine the APR information into a single, clear statement: '0% intro APR for 12 months, then 18.9% APR representative (variable)'.\n2. **Fee Transparency**: List all applicable fees upfront, even if they are \u00a30 (e.g., cash advance, balance transfer, foreign transaction fees).\n3. **Content Completeness**: Expand the benefits and features list significantly to provide a comprehensive overview (e.g., travel insurance, purchase protection, sign-up bonus, etc.).\n4. **Promotional Terms**: Replace 'Terms apply' with specific details or a clear link to the full terms and conditions. If applicable, state the offer's expiration date.\n5. **Structure & Length**: Expand the product description to meet the 100-300 word target. Implement standardised headings such as 'Benefits', 'Fees', 'Requirements', and 'Terms' to improve readability and consistency.\n6. **Language**: Replace 'Apply if you qualify' with more precise language like 'Subject to status and credit approval'."
