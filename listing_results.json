        "listing": "Stellar Rewards Platinum by NovaBank is a credit card that helps you earn money back every time you spend. If you\u2019re not familiar with credit cards, here\u2019s how it works: you get 2% cashback on everything you buy, which means for every \u00a3100 you spend, you get \u00a32 back. For the first 12 months, you won\u2019t pay any interest on your purchases (this is called a 0% introductory APR). After that, the interest rate is 18.9% (variable), which means it can change. There\u2019s an annual fee of \u00a395, and if you pay late, the fee can be up to \u00a312. This card is best for people with a good to excellent credit score (881-999). You don\u2019t pay extra when you use your card abroad. All the fees and requirements are explained clearly, so you know what you\u2019re signing up for. You can apply online, and NovaBank will let you know quickly if you\u2019re approved. Using a card like this responsibly can help you build your credit history and earn rewards at the same time.\n",

            "suggestions": "The listing is mostly compliant but requires several improvements to fully meet marketplace standards and FCA regulations:\n\n1.  **APR Disclosure**: The ongoing APR should explicitly state 'representative'. Change 'After that, the interest rate is 18.9% (variable)' to 'After that, the representative APR is 18.9% (variable)'.\n2.  **Content Quality - Language & Clarity**: Several sentences exceed the recommended 15-20 word limit. Break down longer sentences for better readability. For example, the explanation of cashback and the concluding sentence about credit building could be more concise.\n3.  **Brand & Tone Alignment / Prohibited Language**: Remove the self-congratulatory and vague promotional statement: 'All the fees and requirements are explained clearly, so you know what you\u2019re signing up for.' This goes against the guideline to avoid overly promotional language and focus on factual benefits.\n4.  **Prohibited Language - Misleading Claims**: While 'quickly if you\u2019re approved' is not 'instant approval', it's close to a prohibited claim. Rephrase to 'You can apply online with a quick application process' or 'NovaBank aims for a quick application review' to avoid any ambiguity.\n5.  **User Experience - Readability & Consistent Structure**: The listing is currently a single paragraph. To improve readability and scanning, structure the content with clear headings (e.g., 'Benefits', 'Fees', 'Eligibility') and use bullet points for features, benefits, and fees.\n6.  **Content Quality - Redundant Explanation**: The detailed explanation of how cashback works ('If you\u2019re not familiar with credit cards...') could be condensed. For example, 'Earn 2% cashback on all purchases (equivalent to \u00a32 for every \u00a3100 spent)' is more concise."

For example: '0% intro APR for 12 months, then 18.9% APR representative (variable)'.\n2.  **Fee Transparency**: While 'No annual fee' is mentioned, a comprehensive list of all applicable fees (e.g., late payment fee, cash advance fee, foreign transaction fee) must be provided upfront. For example: 'Annual fee: \u00a30, Late payment fee: up to \u00a312, Cash advance fee: 3% or \u00a33 (whichever is greater)'.\n3.  **Credit Requirements**: 'Eligibility: Credit approval required' is too vague. Clearly define the eligibility criteria, such as required credit score ranges or credit history type. For example: 'Requires good to excellent credit (Experian credit score 881-999 or equivalent)'.\n4.  **Prohibited Language**: Remove 'instant approval!' This is a misleading claim and explicitly prohibited. Replace with compliant phrasing like 'Subject to status and credit approval' or 'Quick application process'.\n5.  **Vague Promotional Terms**: Replace 'Low rates', 'Low interest rates', and 'Save on interest' with specific, factual benefits and clear terms. For example, instead of 'low rates', state the actual representative APR.\n6.  **Content Length & Completeness**: The description is too short. Expand the content to target 100-300 words, providing a comprehensive list of benefits, features, and detailed terms.\n7.  **Consistent Structure**: Adopt the standardised headings: 'Benefits', 'Fees', 'Requirements', and 'Terms' to ensure uniform formatting and clarity.\n8.  **Brand & Tone Alignment**: The tone is overly promotional ('Enjoy low rates'). Shift to a more factual, professional, and informative tone, focusing on verifiable benefits rather than sales-heavy language.\n9.  **Ethical Standards**: Ensure all claims are substantiated and verifiable, and terms are represented fairly without exaggeration, in accordance with FCA guidelines."

Here are the suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **APR Disclosure**: Combine the introductory and ongoing APR into a single, clear statement. Explicitly state 'representative (variable)' for the ongoing APR, e.g., '0% intro APR for 9 months, then 16.9% APR representative (variable)'.\n2.  **Fee Transparency**: List all applicable fees upfront, not just annual and late fees. This should include common fees such as foreign transaction fees, cash advance fees, balance transfer fees, etc., if they apply.\n3.  **Credit Requirements**: Specify the credit bureau for the credit score requirement (e.g., 'Experian credit score 850+ or equivalent') to provide clearer eligibility criteria.\n4.  **Content Completeness**: Expand on the listed benefits ('Travel insurance', 'Purchase protection') by providing more detail on what they specifically cover. Include a more comprehensive list of all features and benefits the card offers.\n5.  **Promotional Terms**: If the '0% intro APR for 9 months' is a limited-time offer, clearly state its expiration date.\n6.  **Content Length & Structure**: The listing is too brief. Expand the product description to be between 100-300 words, providing more context and detail. Structure the content using the standardised headings: 'Benefits', 'Fees', 'Eligibility Requirements', and 'Terms' for improved readability and consistency.\n7.  **Brand & Tone Alignment**: While factual, the tone is a bit dry. Infuse a slightly more informative and professional tone to align with the marketplace's 'friendly, professional, informative' brand voice.\n8.  **Ethical Standards**: Ensure all material terms, especially the representative APR and a comprehensive list of fees, are prominently disclosed in line with FCA guidelines."

For every purchase you make, you\u2019ll get 1.2% cashback, which means a small amount of money is returned to you based on what you spend. This card is best for people who have a good credit score (800 or above). All the costs and requirements are explained clearly, so you know what to expect.
